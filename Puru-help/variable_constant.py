##We cannot name variable which are python keywords

you = 96

#break = it cannot be a variable because it comes in python keywords

###Rules to name variables in python
#1. variable names they should start from either alphabhets or underscore (_)
#2. variables can have numbers inside their name but they shouldn't start with numbers
#3. variables name cannot be python keywords
#4. variable name should appropiate

#storing age
x = 13 # this can be variable name but variable name should appropiate
print("Puru is", x)
#storing age
age = 13 #variable name should appropiate
print("Puru is", age)



#storing class of the person

abc = 8 # this can be variable name but variable name should appropiate


class_number = 8#variable name should appropiate
