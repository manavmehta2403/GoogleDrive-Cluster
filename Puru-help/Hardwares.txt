Hardware: 

Chipset / Chip / Processor:-
ALU: Arithmetic Logical Unit it used to perform all the algorthim in the computer. 
CU: Control Unit it is used to control the flow data.
Register: It used to store the address of the data.

BUS: It is the embedde wires which used to transfer data in chipset.

*Low-level language are the language used by the chip to execute information from the data. It is in menosomic code in form of bits (0 and 1). Ex: ARM processor*

*High-level language these languages use English words to execute information from the data. Ex Python*

*We have seen Python has IDLE which act as the medium that convert high-level language to low level language. So, that chip can understand the code.*

*Interpertor Compier is used to convert high-level language into low-level language.*


*Python uses interpreter. Interpeter is a software that execute each line of the code one by one.
Interpeter is used for checking errors. But it run slow.*

*Compiler is the software that execute whole code in one go. Compiler is hard for checking the errors but it run fast.*




Primary memory and Secondary memory.

RAM is volatile memory, which loses the data as soon as the execution stop. (power-cut) 3600MHz. Speed of the computer

Python variables and data is stored in RAM.

Secondary memory is remain even after execution is stop. 520Mbps. Storage of the computer. Python files are stored in the secondary memory.




Bits 
Expanded form

34 = 3 x 10 + 4 

Bits: - O when power is off and 1 when power is on
