##print function is used to display data

print("There you are")

print(5)

print("I am five years old")

##commas are used to print one data after the another data
print("I am",5,"years old")

print("forever")

print(4,"ever")

print("4ever") ###but 4 will be str not int



##print has special ability that is known as .format

print("{}ever".format(4)) ##these curly brackets hold the space for data for the exact way that we
##want line to print

#%d ==> int , %s ==> string, %g ==> float
"%.2g means two digits after decimals"
string = 'In %d years I have spotted %.2g %s.' % (3, 0.1433, 'camels')
print(string)

##Commas to print different data with a space.

##maximum time comma does the work
