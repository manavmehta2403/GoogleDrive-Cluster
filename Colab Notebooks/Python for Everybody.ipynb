It has been around for some considerable time having been originally conceived back in the 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. The language is named after one of Guido’s favourite programs “Monty Pythons Flying Circus”, a classic and somewhat anarchic British comedy sketch show originally running from 1969 to 1974 (but which has been rerun on various stations ever since) and with several film spin offs. You will even find various references to this show in the documentation available with Python. As a language it has gained in interest over recent years, particularly within the commercial world, with many people wanting to learn the language.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7noxNwxiGCuH"},"source":["There are several different programming paradigms that a programming language may allow developers to code in, these are: • Procedural Programming in which a program is represented as a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what it should do explicitly. Procedures and/ or functions are used to provide structure to the program; with control structures such as if statements and loop constructs to manage which steps are executed and how many times. Languages typifying this approach include C and Pascal. • Declarative Programming languages, such as Prolog, that allow developers to describe how a problem should be solved, with the language/environment determining how the solution should be implemented. SQL (a database query language) is one of the most common declarative languages that you are likely to encounter. • Object Oriented Programming approaches that represent a system in terms of the objects that form that system. Each object can hold its own data (also known as state) as well as define behaviour that defines what the object can do. A computer program is formed from a set of these objects co-operating together. Languages such as Java and C# typify the object oriented approach. • Functional Programming languages decompose a problem into a set of functions. Each function is independent of any external state, operating only on the inputs they received to generate their outputs. The programming language Haskell is an example of a functional programming language. Some programming languages are considered to be hybrid languages; that is they allow developers to utilise a combination of difference approaches within the same program. Python is an example of a hybrid programming language as it allows you to write very procedural code, to use objects in an object oriented manner and to write functional programs. Each of these approaches is covered in this book.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ukQr_ivBcrfO"},"source":["Following is the list of reserved keywords in Python 3 (33 keywords)\n","\n","and,\n","except,\n","lambda,\n","with,\n","as,\n","finally,\n","nonlocal,\n","while,\n","assert,\n","false,\n","None,\n","yield,\n","break,\n","for,\n","not,\n","class,\n","from,\n","or,\n","continue,\n","global,\n","pass,\n","def,\n","if,\n","raise,\n","del,\n","import,\n","return,\n","elif,\n","in,\n","True,\n","else,\n","is,\n","try"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pO0UN8t6hESR"},"source":["(>>>) The prompt is used to ask the user what nest instruction need to give the computer."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RaAZBDp7GCuL"},"source":["user_name = input('Enter your name: ') \n","\n","This statement does several things. It first executes another function called input(). This function is passed a string—which is known as an argument—to use when it prompts the user for input. This function input(), is again a built-in function that is part of the Python language. In this case it will display the string you provide as a prompt to the user and wait until the user types something in followed by the return key. Whatever the user types in is then returned as the result of executing the input() function. In this case that result is then stored in the variable user_name. A variable is a named area of the computers’ memory that can be used to hold things (often referred to as data) such as strings, numbers, boolean such as True/ False etc. In this case the variable user_name is acting as a label for an area of memory which will hold the string entered by the user.\n","\n","This simplified picture illustrates how a variable, such as user_name, can reference an area of memory containing actual data. In this diagram the memory is shown as a two dimensional grid of memory locations. Each location has an address associated with it. This address is unique within the memory and can be used to return to the data held at that location. This address is often referred to as the memory address of the data. It is this memory address that is actually held in the variable user_name; this is why the user_name variable is shown as pointing to the area in memory containing the string 'John'. Thus the variable user_name allows us to access this area of memory easily and conveniently. For example, if we want to get hold of the name entered by the user in another statement, we can do so merely by referencing the variable user_name. Indeed, this is exactly what we do in the second statement we added to our program.

If we want to, we can reuse the variable to hold the name of that best friend. For example: \n","\n","print('Hello, world') \n","name = input('Enter your name: ') \n","print('Hello', name) \n","name = input('What is the name of your best friend: ') \n","print('Hello Best Friend', name) \n","\n","When we run this version of the program and the user enters 'John' for their name and 'Denise' for their best friends’ name we will see:\n","\n","Hello, world \n","Enter your name: John Hello \n","John What is the name of your best friend: Denise \n","Hello Best Friend Denise \n","\n","As you can see from this when the string 'Hello Best Friend' is printed, it is the name 'Denise' that is printed alongside it.
